## Client Side Application 
#### Darcie Pearson, 14/5/2023

Movie browsing and searching application that fetches data from IMDB.

# Running this application 
Due to dependencies clashes, npm install --force must be used to install node modules. Not best practice but was the only way it would work with the modules I have used. 

### `npm install --force` 

Then, 

### `npm start`

To run the application.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
